<p align="center">An Android library that prevents your app from being pirated / cracked using Google Play Licensing (LVL), APK signature protection and more.</p>

## Disclaimer
This library applies some techniques to help protect your app's users and attempt to thwart reverse engineers and attackers. BUT, this isn't guaranteed to stop your app from getting pirated. There is no such thing as 100% security, and a determined and skilled attacker with enough time, could remove these checks from the code. The real objective here is to raise the bar out of reach of opportunist and automatic attackers.

Some of the techniques included in this library can be found [here](https://www.airpair.com/android/posts/adding-tampering-detection-to-your-android-app).


## How to include
Add the repository to your project **build.gradle**:

```Javascript
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}
```

And add the library to your module **build.gradle**:

```Javascript
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.javiersantos:PiracyChecker:1.0.2'
}
```

## Recommendations
* Always enable ProGuard in your production release. Always, without exceptions.
* PiracyChecker should be included in your `onCreate` method in order to check for a valid license as soon as possible.
* It's recommended to show a new Activity instead of a Dialog when the license is not valid. This way you make sure that the main activity of the app is finished. See "[Display results in a Dialog or a new Activity](https://github.com/javiersantos/PiracyChecker#display-results-in-a-dialog-or-a-new-activity)".  
* Don't forget to enable ProGuard ;)

## Usage

### Verify Google Play Licensing (LVL)
Google Play offers a licensing service that lets you enforce licensing policies for applications that you publish on Google Play. With Google Play Licensing, your application can query Google Play to obtain the licensing status for the current user.

Any application that you publish through Google Play can use the Google Play Licensing service. No special account or registration is needed.

For more information check out the [Google Developers page](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html).
 
```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableGooglePlayLicensing("BASE_64_LICENSE_KEY")
	...
	.start();
```

In order to retrieve your BASE64 license key your app must be uploaded to the [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/). Then access to your app -> Services and APIs.

When using Google Play Licensing your should call `.destroy()` in the `onDestroy()` method of your Activity to avoid multiple instances of the service running. Have a look to the Wiki for a [sample Activity](https://github.com/javiersantos/PiracyChecker/wiki/Using-Google-Play-Licensing-(LVL)) with `.destroy()`.

### Verify your app's signing certificate (signature)
In a nutshell, developers must sign applications with their private key/certificate (contained in a .keystore file) before the app can be installed on user devices. The signing certificate must stay consistent throughout the life of the app, and typically have an expiry date of 25 years in the future.

The app signature will be broken if the .apk is altered in any way â€” unsigned apps cannot typically be installed. We can imagine an attacker removing license-checking code to enable full app features without paying, for instance. A more dangerous example would be altering the .apk to include malware in a legitimate app to harvest sensitive user data. In order for the altered .apk to be installed, the attacker must resign it.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableSigningCertificate("478yYkKAQF+KST8y4ATKvHkYibo=") // The original APK signature for the PRODUCTION version
	...
	.start();
```

**BE CAREFUL!!** Your app signature can be retrieved using a PiracyCheckerUtils method. Make sure that you have signed your APK using your PRODUCTION keystore (not using the DEBUG one) and installed the version that you plan to distribute. Then copy the signature returned by this method on the console and paste in `.enableSigningCertificate("YOUR_APK_SIGNATURE")`

```Java
// This method will print your app signature in the console
Log.e("SIGNATURE", PiracyCheckerUtils.getAPKSignature(this));
```

### Verify the installer
If you only plan to distribute the app on a particular store this technique will block from installing the app using any another store.

Supported stores: Google Play, Amazon App Store and Samsung Galaxy Apps.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableInstallerId(InstallerID.GOOGLE_PLAY)
	.enableInstallerId(InstallerID.AMAZON_APP_STORE)
	.enableInstallerId(InstallerID.GALAXY_APPS)
	...
	.start();
```

**BE CAREFUL!!** This is a really restrictive technique since it will block your app from being installed using another market or directly installing the .apk on the device. It isn't recommended for most cases.

### Verify the use of pirate apps
If you want to check if user has pirate apps installed, you can use this code.

It will check for: Lucky Patcher, Freedom and CreeHack.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableUnauthorizedAppsCheck()
	...
	.start();
```

You can block the app even when this pirate apps has been uninstalled. This prevents the app from being patched and then uninstall the pirate app in order to continue using your app. The library will save a `SharedPreference` value to know when a pirate app has been detected.

There are two ways to do this:

Define the `SharedPreferences` and the name of the preference where you want to save the result.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableUnauthorizedAppsCheck()
	.blockIfUnauthorizedAppUninstalled(preferences, "app_unauthorized") // Change "app_unauthorized" with your own value
	...
	.start();
```

Define the `SharedPreferences` name and the name of the preference where you want to save the result.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableUnauthorizedAppsCheck()
	.blockIfUnauthorizedAppUninstalled("license_preferences", "app_unauthorized") // Change "license_preferences" and "app_unauthorized" with your own value
	...
	.start();
```

### Verify the use of third-party store apps
If you want to check if user has third-party store apps installed, you can use this code.

It will check for: Aptoide, BlackMart, Mobogenie, 1Mobile, GetApk, GetJar and SlideMe.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableStoresCheck()
	...
	.start();
```

### Verify if app is a debug build
If your app is running on an emulator outside the development process, it gives an indication that someone other than you is trying to analyze the app.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableDebugCheck()
	...
	.start();
```

### Verify if app is being run in an emulator
Outside of development, it's unlikely that your app should be running on an emulator, and releasing apps with debuggable enabled is discouraged as it allows connected computers to access and debug the app via the Android Debug Bridge.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableEmulatorCheck()
	...
	.start();
```

### Save the result of the license check in `SharedPreferences`

Saving the result of the license check is useful for checking the license status without calling `.start()` multiple times.

There are two ways to do this:

Define the `SharedPreferences` and the name of the preference where you want to save the result.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.saveResultToSharedPreferences(preferences, "valid_license") // Change "valid_license" with your own value
	...
	.start();
```

Define the `SharedPreferences` name and the name of the preference where you want to save the result.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.saveResultToSharedPreferences("license_preferences", "valid_license") // Change "license_preferences" and "valid_license" with your own value
	...
	.start();
```


## Customizations

### Display results in a Dialog or a new Activity

It's recommended to show a new Activity instead of a Dialog when the license is not valid. This way you make sure that the main activity of the app is finished.

By default a non-cancelable Dialog will be displayed.

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.display(Display.ACTIVITY)
	...
	.start();
```

By default, the displayed Activity will use the library colors. To apply a custom primary and primary dark color use `.withActivityColor(R.color.colorPrimary, R.color.colorPrimaryDark)`.

### Using custom callbacks
Adding a callback to the builder allows you to customize what will happen when the license has been checked and manage the license check errors if the user is not allowed to use the app. Keep in mind that when using this method **you must be aware of blocking the app from unauthorized users**.

By default, the library will display a non-cancelable dialog if the user is not allowed to use the app, otherwise nothing will happen.

Use the builder and add following:

```Java
.callback(new PiracyCheckerCallback() {
	@Override
	public void allow() {
		// Do something when the user is allowed to use the app
	}
	
	@Override
	public void dontAllow(@NonNull PiracyCheckerError error, @Nullable PirateApp app) {
		// You can either do something specific when the user is not allowed to use the app
		// Or manage the error, using the 'error' parameter, yourself (Check errors at {@link PiracyCheckerError}).
		
		// Additionally, if you enabled the check of pirate apps and/or third-party stores, the 'app' param
		// is the app that has been detected on device. App can be null, and when null, it means no pirate app or store was found,
		// or you disabled the check for those apps.
		// This allows you to let users know the possible reasons why license is been invalid.
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(@NonNull PiracyCheckerError error) {
		// This method is not required to be implemented/overriden but...
		// You can either do something specific when an error occurs while checking the license,
		// Or manage the error, using the 'error' parameter, yourself (Check errors at {@link PiracyCheckerError}).
    }
})
```

## FAQs
#### Can I protect my app using more than one validation method?
Sure. You can use as many validation methods in the builder as you want. For example:

```Java
new PiracyChecker(this)
	.enableGooglePlayLicensing("BASE_64_LICENSE_KEY")
	.enableSigningCertificate("YOUR_APK_SIGNATURE")
	.enableUnauthorizedAppsCheck()
	.saveResultToSharedPreferences("my_app_preferences", "valid_license");
	...
	.start();
```
